        <h2>Problem Overview</h2>
        <div class="bg_text">
          <h5>Summary</h5>
          <p>Even though there are a lot of big names in the cloud storage and organization industry, a rising competitor with the right combination of features to meet the needs of a target audience could dominate the market. We set out to create
            that competitor.</p>
          <!--my roles/tools-->
          <h5>My Role</h5>
          <p>I worked as the core designer for the Dreamers project. I was responsible for the research and creation of the logo and brand, as well as all aspects of user research, testing, and design of the Dreamers site itself. </p>
          <h5>Tools and Deliverables</h5>
          <p>Using Figma and InVision as tools I produced a user survey and analysis, three user personas, competitive analysis, user stories, user flows, wireframing, prototype(s), prototype testing, user testing, and created a brand and logo for
            the project.</p>

      <section data-aos="fade-left" class="problem">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <div class="bg_text">
          <p>There are many well-known cloud storage sites in use today but they are all designed for one set of tasks or user group and many are hard to use or plain looking. So, we wanted to learn what features users actually needed and use what we
            learned to create a product that would satisfy the needs of the client and the user; while still being intuitive to use, aesthetically pleasing, and unique.</p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <!--solution-->
      <section class="solution">
        <h2 data-aos="fade-right">The Solution</h2>
        <div data-aos="fade-right">
          <p class="bg_text">Through user research and competitive analysis we discovered that a competitor with a large amount of free and secure storage, a broad target audience, and an easy to use interface, could take the market by storm.
            Then through the creation of user story and user personas; we discovered the features users actually wanted and needed.
            And so the concept of <strong>Dreamers was born; with 20GB of free secure cloud storage, the ability to upload files and images, download, edit, add and sort files using labels or folders, create documents, spreadsheets, notes,
              presentations, as well as share content and collaborate via video conference.</strong>
            we then put it all into action with user flows, wireframing, mockups, branding, prototypes, and tested it all with usability testing and analysis.</p>

        <h2>User Survey Research</h2>
        <div class="bg_text">
          <h5>Goals:</h5>
          <p>Before starting the design, we created and deployed a user survey to gather information and data about potential user groups, the competition, and current users' pain points and happy moments.</p>
          <h5>Results:</h5>
          <ul class="color">
            <li>88% of users reported using cloud storage services</li>
            <li>95.2% reported wanting to use folders to organize their content</li>
            <li>47.6% reported wanting to use labels</li>
            <li>There was also a general interest in collaboration features</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Summary</h5>
          <p>The results were helpful but somewhat inconclusive. The word choice and question options allowed for a lot of mixed and unhelpful data that went beyond the scope of the project. <br>In the future more time will be spent crafting
            questions to be more of an asset for the project.</p>

          <p>We then created a working prototype using InVision and our wireframes and tested it with two different types of users. We tested it both in-person and remotely using screen record and video calling using an identical testing script to
            help assure testing result accuracy. Each tester was asked to complete three tasks on the site: <strong> sign up for an account, add a piece of content, and organize a piece of content.</strong> Neither user had any significant issues
            completing the tasks
            and did so with little to no input or help from the tester.</p>

          <h5>Iterations</h5>
          <p>After concluding user testing on the wireframes one main issue with the design became clear; the navigation buttons looked like selection buttons and not like navigation buttons which caused users some trouble while navigating the site.
            Before moving on to high-fidelity mock-ups the navigation button was changed from the top version to the bottom version and implemented throughout the site to enhance overall usability.</p>

Overall we got good results from the user tests. All three users enjoyed the site as a whole and had no problems navigating around the site.</p>
          <h5>Issues & Changes</h5>
          <dt> <strong>I.</strong> When rendered on a desktop the screens were fine but when viewed on a Mac-book the design was way too big.</dt>
          <dd>This may be due to the prototype being in Figma as the frame sizes are standard and should have no issues scaling properly.</dd>
          <dt> <strong>II.</strong> There were unintentionally two different types of screens for an overlay (one for the folder and one for labels).</dt>
          <dd>Both screens were changed to the label format.</dd>
          <dt> <strong>III.</strong> On the sign up screen the highlighted “box” moves along the page and seems disorganized.</dt>
          <dd>All screens were changed to reflect the middle formatting.</dd>
          <dt> <strong>IV.</strong> Most buttons had to be clicked twice (once to select one to navigate) and caused a lot of confusion.</dt>
          <dd>Changed buttons to be “hover” for color change and  one click to navigate.</dd>
          <dt> <strong>V.</strong> This user testing also made me aware of some inconsistencies in my design where the buttons shift slightly or the colors change unnecessarily.</dt>
          <dd>I went back to discover and remedy any inconsistencies throughout the site.</dd>

        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <div class="bg_text">
          <p>While crafting the survey for this project we included too many short answer questions which lead to a lot of data, but most of it was muddled and had no consensus. When we were crafting the survey we were determined to believe that
            short-answer questions would give the best range of data to work with. This project was a hard lesson on how wrong that was and how an unhelpful survey can cause significant scope creep, iterations, and an unfriendly user design.
            Partially due to the survey, but also partially due to our incessant need to attempt to overachieve and do more than was asked, we ended up creating a much larger project for ourselves by going beyond what the client asked for and
            offering many features that while they are neat; they only took time away from the rest of the design that mattered more to the client and users. Additionally because we had made this project into something so much bigger, we needed to
            make SIGNIFICANTLY more screens than we had anticipated ,or had time to make, so many screens were rushed which is why the design was plagued with jumping elements until we eliminated some of the extra factors and brought Dreamers back
            into the scope of the project. After that we were able to give more attention to the layout and colors themselves and bring Dreamers back around to really create a design we were happy with and proud of.
          </p>
          <h5>Lessons Learned</h5>
          <ul class="color">
            <li>Stay within the scope of the project</li>
            <li>Don't overthink the design</li>
            <li>Create good, through survey questions to be a better asset to the process</li>
