                    <p>I was responsible for owning the MS Design System as its own product.</p>
                  <!--  <h5>Tools</h5>
                    <p>I used Figma as the platform for our Design System due to its advanced component properties.</p>  -->

                    <p>After the audit and proof of concept, it was finally time to start on MS 3.0 Design System. As the system would be actively used while I am building it; I needed to work incrementally and mitigate risk throughout. Although I encountered more than a few bumps in the road along the way, each problem was a unique challenge that made me a better designer.</p>

                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <p>Establishing a clear governance process that helps users understand what to do when and is essential for a Design System that stands the test of time.  However, this process does not yet exist.</p>
                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <p>Working with UX leads I created and implemented our Design System Governance Process. This process defined how a component should be added to, updated, or removed from our Design System. To aid users with understanding the process, I created a flow diagram and added it to our system as a reference.</p>

                    <p>Existing typography was not utilizing a hierarchal scale, leading to design and UI inconsistencies.</p>
                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <p>I implemented a typography scale, to create visual consistency and hierarchy across the user experience. The scale also made it easier for designers to select the appropriate and consistent style for their designs.</p>

                <div class="bg_text">
                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <p>Creating a highly flexible system that works for a wide range of use cases is not something that can be done in a vacuum. I needed to facilitate constant feedback from many different sources to validate my work.</p>
                    <h4>Solution(s)</h4>
                    <h5>Design System and Component Library Retro</h5>
                    <p>Hosting the Retro, I brought together design and development leads to discuss our Design System/Component Library. We focused on what was working, what was not, and what we could improve on.</p>
                    <h5>Office Hours</h5>
                    <p>I wanted to make sure I had blocked off time available, twice a week, where Designers could meet with me as a resource. Designers asked questions about components, how to use them, which one to use for a specific use case, or potential updates they wanted to request.</p>
                    <h5>Component Review</h5>
                    <p>On a weekly basis I held a component review, bringing together UX Leads. We discussed new component requests, how the components might be used in their product(s), any concerns, and to review component documentation. This review was invaluable because it allowed me to validate component utility and flexibility cross-functionally.</p>

                    <p>These are just a few of the many essential feedback loops I incorporated into our Design System.</p>

                <div class="bg_text">
                    <h5>Problem</h5>
                    <p>Existing system did not have a structure and components were difficult to find.</p>
                    <h5>Solution</h5>
                    <p>Using Atomic Design principles by Brad Frost as inspiration I created our Design System structure. Divided up into four main sections: atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates. Each “level” builds upon the last - starting with the atoms, and eventually leading to page templates.</p> <p>This inherently creates an extremely flexible system that can stand the test of time.</p>

                <h2>Good Documentation</h2>
                <div class="bg_text">
                    <p>Creating good documentation is essential to any Design System or Component Library. It is extremely helpful for recording design decisions, intended development behavior, micro-interactions, anatomy, and usage.</p>
                    <p> Having documentation to reference also helps to ensure consistency in component use. This is also helpful during design reviews to validate how a component is being used.</p>
                    <p>To keep our documentation constant, and to save time, I created a reusable template. This was a huge time saver and also facilitated consistency in our system.</p>

                <div class="bg_text">
                    <p>Creating flexible components was essential to the success of our Design System. If components are created for a specific use case only, it can be very challenging to apply the same component to a different use case. This is because if the new use case requires a tweak to the original component, every instance of the component will be affected. Compound this over the whole system and you have a HUGE problem. Every component added to the system was validated for flexibility, creating an extremely capable Design System.</p>

                    <p>Utilizing tokens and variables within our design system was a large project milestone. Due to implementing these at the beginning, changes to component colors are a breeze.</p>

                    <p>MS 3.0 is a huge success. The system is actively used by all our designers, making up at least 80% of their work. Additionally, the Storybook Component library is being implemented incrementally in our products. As a dedicated resource for our Design System, I was able to create flexible headless components and limit one-off additions to the system. This enabled the creation of an extremely capable and robust Design System. Throughout this process of defining, creating, and evangelizing our Design System I was able to learn powerful, efficient ways to construct components that can be used at scale while creating a system easily maintainable at scale. Part of the governance process included a weekly component review where I brought together the UX Leads to discuss new components, how they might be used in their products, any concerns, and to review component documentation. This was an invaluable part of the process because it allowed me to vet component utility to validate a component's flexibility in a wide range of use cases.</p>

                    <p>Due to the complexity, enormity, and ever-changing nature of this project; I found myself tested in ways I have never been. The unique complexity of our MS 3.0 Design System tested everything I knew and thought I knew about Design Systems. The process of developing and maintaining our system pushed me to think outside the box, face my fears, and truly find my voice as a respected member of our team.</p>
