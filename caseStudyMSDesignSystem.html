                <div class="bg_text">
                    <h4>MS 3.0 Design System is the largest project I have ever been responsible for leading and executing. It is also the most rewarding project I have worked on thus far.</h4>
                    <!-- My roles/tools -->
                    <h5>My Role</h5>
                    <p>I was responsible for owning the MS Design System as its own product.</p>
                    <h5>Tools</h5>
                    <p>I used Figma as the platform for our Design System due to its advanced component properties.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <!-- Approach -->
            <section data-aos="fade-left" class="approach">
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <div class="bg_text">
                    <p>After the audit and proof of concept, it was finally time to start on MS 3.0 Design System.</p>
                    <p>A Design System is a living, and continually evolving project; MS 3.0 was no different. Knowing this, I took an organized and incremental approach to bringing our Design System to life.  I implemented structure, documentation, sourced feedback, recorded and communicated updates, and worked to continually improve our System at every turn.</p>
                    <p>Throughout this journey, I encountered more than a few bumps in the road along the way. Each problem uniquely challenged me; making our System and I better along the way.</p>

            <!--Governance Process-->
            <section data-aos="fade-right" class="governance process">
                <h2>Governance Process</h2>
                <div class="bg_text">
                    <p>One of the primary objectives given to me was to create and establish a Governance process for the Design System. The Governance process defines the flow to be followed for adding new components, updating components, and adding components to Storybook. The purpose of the Governance process is to validate each component addition or update for flexibility and cross-functional utility.</p>

            <!-- Sourcing Feedback -->
            <section data-aos="fade-left" class="sourcing feedback">
                <h2>Sourcing Feedback</h2>
                <div class="bg_text">
                    <p>Creating a highly flexible system that works for a wide range of use cases is not something that can be done in a vacuum. I facilitated constant feedback from many different sources to validate the work I was doing.</p>
                    <h5>Weekly Component Review</h5>
                    <p>I held a weekly meeting with UX Leads to review upcoming components; extremely valuable for creating cross-functional components.</p>
                    <h5>Design System and Component Library Retro</h5>
                    <p>Hosting the Retro, I brought together design and development leads to discuss our Design System/Component Library. We focused on what was working, what was not, and what we could improve on.</p>
                    <h5>Office Hours</h5>
                    <p>I wanted to make sure I had blocked off time available, twice a week, where Designers could meet with me as a resource. Designers asked questions about components, how to use them, which one to use for a specific use case, or potential updates they wanted to request. These hours were highly utilized and proved beneficial to the other designers.</p>
                    <p>These are just a few of the many feedback loops incorporated into owning our Design System; essential to creating a balanced system.</p>

                <h2>Establishing Structure</h2>
                <div class="bg_text">
                    <p>Using Atomic Design principles by Brad Frost as inspiration I created our Design System structure. 
                        Divided up into four main sections: atoms, molecules, organisms, and templates. Each “level” builds upon the last - starting with the atoms, and eventually leading to page templates. This inherently creates an extremely flexible system that can support a multitude of different use cases now </p>

            <!-- Design Tokens -->
            <section data-aos="fade-left" class="Design Tokens">
                <h2>Design Tokens Using Tokens Studio</h2>
                <div class="bg_text">
                    <p>In comes Tokens Studio, a plugin built for Figma, enabling the creation of design tokens for export in multiple different coding languages.</p>
                    <p>When I found Tokens Studio I thought I had found the perfect simple solution; but that is only where my problems began.</p>
                    <p>The plugin itself is extremely powerful and flexible; with an extremely sharp learning curve. There is very limited documentation on how to use it - for designers or developers. I spent the next several days collaborating with the lead developer tasked with working on our Storybook library; figuring out how we could make this work and setting up the first components. This was very challenging and required near constant back and forth with the lead developer to smooth out kinks and craft the basis for Tokens within our Component Library.</p>

The purpose of the Governance process is to validate each component addition or update for flexibility and for cross functional utility.</p>
                    <p>Part of the governance process included a weekly component review where I brought together the UX Leads to discuss new components, how they might be used in their individual products, any concerns, and to review component documentation. This was an invaluable part of the process because it allowed me to vet component utility to validate a components flexibility in a wide range of use cases.</p>

                <h2>Result</h2>
                <div class="bg_text">
                    <p>MS 3.0 is a huge success. The system is actively used by all our designers, making up at least 80% of in their work. Additionally, the Storybook Component library is being implemented incrementally in our products.</p>
                    <p>By being the dedicated resource for our Design System I was able to create flexible headless components and limit one-off additions to the system. This enabled the creation of an extremely capable and robust Design System. Throughout this process of defining, creating, and evangelizing our Design System I was able to learn powerful, efficient ways to construct components that can be used at scale while creating a system easily maintainable at scale.</p>
