      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>There are many well-known cloud storage sites in use today but they are all designed for one set of tasks or user group and many are hard to use and lack a solid organizational users. So I wanted to create a cloud storage site for anyone; as unique as every one of its users that would allow them to save and organize content no matter where their dreams take them.</p>
      <!--my roles/tools-->
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <p>UX Design, Visual Design, Brand Identity</p>
      <h3>Tools and Deliverables</h3>
      <p>Using Figma and InVision as tools I produced a user survey and analysis, three user personas, competitve analysis, user stories, user flows, wireframes, prototype(s), prototype testing, user testing, and created a brand and logo for the project.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="problem">
      <h2>The Probelm</h2>
      <p>My client came to me with a lot of excitement for the possibilities in the cloud storage industry market. They believed that the <b>market is still young and that the right competitor, with the right features, could dominate the market.</b> They also stated that they felt collaboration would an important aspect of the site to leverage growth and a requested feature by its users.
      Additionally the project was lacking a brand direction or identity. <br>The problem then became creating an app that satisfied the wants of the client with the needs of site users and to create an appealing brand and product to dominate the cloud storage market.</p>
    <!--solution-->
    <section class="solution">
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>Through user research and competitive analysis I discovered that a competitor with a large amount of free and secure storage, a broad target audience, and an easy to use interface, could take the market by storm.
            Then through the creation of user story and user personas; I discovered the features users actually wanted and needed.
            And so the concept of <b>Dreamers was born; with 20GB of free secure cloud storage, the ability to upload files and images, download, edit, add and sort files using labels or folders, create documents, spreadsheets, notes, presentations, as well as share content and collaborate via video conference.</b>
            I then put it all into action with user flows, wireframes, mockups, branding, prototypes, and tested it all with mockup usability testing and analysis.<br><a class="inline-link" target="_blank" href="https://invis.io/79ORKW3YTQ4#/318584690_Landing">Live Prototype</a></p>

    <!--section class="Research">
      <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
      <p>Before starting the design, I created and deployed a user survey to gather some general information about users to discover and assess the competition, key user groups, and current user wants, needs, and habits. As a result I learned that users wanted the ability to do these key tasks:</p>
      <ul class="color">
        <li>Save content</li>
        <li>Organize Content</li>
        <li>Create Content</li>
        <li>Upload Content</li>
        <li>Share Content</li>
        <li>Download Content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I then used my findings from the analysis to construct three <a class="inline_link" target="_blank" href="">user personas</a>, <a class="inline_link" target="_blank" href="">a SWOT table / competitive analysis</a>, <a class="inline_link" target="_blank" href="">user stories</a>, and <a class="inline_link" target="_blank" href="">user flows</a> to aid in the design and in sketching wireframes.</p>

    <section class="comp-analysis">
      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>After the creation of my user personas I completed a competitive analysis on the three major players in the cloud storage and organization industry to determine the strengths and weaknesses of these three companies: Google Drive, Evernote, Dropbox.</p>
      <div class="SWOT">
      <div class="competitor">
        <h3>Evernote</h3>
        <p>Evernote is a convenient note-taking app with both a mobile and desktop presence. It allows for the transcription of handwritten notes to typed text and the recording of audio notes. It also offers in-text search for notes uploaded to the site. Evernote also offers the option of an unlimited uploads.</p>
        <p>However, in order to have access to the unlimited uploads feature you must purchase one of their plans. <b>The user home dashboard is heavily cluttered,</b> and very confusing for a first time user to navigate. It also uses Google cloud to store the files uploaded to Evernote and overall the site has poor security.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="competitor">
          <h3>Dropbox</h3>
          <p>Dropbox has a very clean and user-friendly interface. The blue used to highlight important parts of the page is very helpful and nice to have. The ability to “star” an item also allows for some organization and the file list is clear and easy to read. Dropbox also had the fastest file upload time of the three.</p>
          <p>However, <b> Dropbox only gives 2gb of free storage to its users </b> and has only one 1,000gb plan available. It also only has three compatible productivity apps and has been plagued with security breaches and questionable practices for the past several years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="competitor">
          <h3>Google drive</h3>
          <p>Google Drive offered the largest amount of free storage, 15gb, for its users out of the other two I researched and its in-house productivity suite with a myriad of comparable apps was a nice feature. Google Drive also offered good collaboration features with the ability to share and collaborate on content in real time with other users. It also offered enhanced security via two-factor authentication methods.</p>
          <p>However, while Google Drive has a clean layout , it sacrificed an intuitive user-friendly interface in favor of a minimalist look. There is also no easy way to organize or sort files and there are a lot of small icons that look similar that must be hovered over/clicked on in order to figure out what they were for. <b>Slow file upload and sync times</b> send some users looking toward other alternatives amid security concerns due to <b>Google Drive scanning every file uploaded</b> to its cloud servers.</p>

        <h3>Hifi I - Initial</h3>
        <p>When I initially layered on the skins to my wireframes I wanted to use a lot of bright colors for every page. When I first had the idea it seemed fun and colorful, in execution it was overwhelming. After going back over my design I realized that all of these colors didn't add anything to the design, in fact they took away from it significantly. The readability of the whole site was poor so before I even did any user testing I went back and revised the color scheme and design for the Dreamers site to tone it down. I also got carried away with my use of multiple background types and images. This step was a really big learning lesson about editing your work and really thinking about your design choice before executing it and evaluating later.</p>

      <h3>Hifi II - Iteration</h3>
      <p>After my initial high-fidelity mock-up it became very clear that I needed to tone down my color palate significantly and so I went back over and got rid of all the neon-esq colors and replaced them with a darker blue and dusty purple toned color palette. The buttons also took on a more rounded look and the file images were taking up too much space on the initial wireframes so I scaled down those as well.</p>

        <h2>Design Dilemma</h2>
        <p>Throughout the duration of the iterations one thing still bothered me, the background and layout. I felt as if I had a lot of wasted space on the page by confining the page content into a box on the page. I knew I wanted to keep the star/space theme but I wanted to brighten it up and not make it feel so dark and gloomy and give the content room to breathe; & I am so glad I did. </p>

        <h3>Hifi III - Iteration Iterated</h3>
        <p>By eliminating the whole image background, more space could be given to the files and it allowed me to further visually separate the folders/buttons from the files on the user dashboard. I also utilized a blue tone color scheme throughout with the image as the header throughout. I also removed the boxes around the files and moved them closer together in order to fit more files on the screen and better utilize the space on the page.</p>

        <p>For this second round of prototype testing I used an identical testing script and I tested three users. Overall I got good results from my user tests. All three users enjoyed the site as a whole and had no problems navigating around the site.</p>
        <h5>Issues & Changes</h5>
      list within a list-
        <dl>
          <dt> <b>I.</b> When rendered on a desktop the screens were fine but when viewed on a Mac-book the design was way too big.</dt>
          <dd>This may be due to the prototype being in Figma as the frame sizes are standard and should have no issues scaling properly.</dd>
          <dt> <b>II.</b> There were unintentionally two different types of screens for an overlay (one for the folder and one for labels).</dt>
          <dd>Both screens were changed to the label format.</dd>
          <dt> <b>III.</b> On the sign up screen the highlighted “box” moves along the page and seems disorganized.</dt>
          <dd>All screens were changed to reflect the middle formatting.</dd>
          <dt> <b>IV.</b> Most buttons had to be clicked twice (once to select one to navigate) and caused a lot of confusion.</dt>
          <dd>Changed buttons to be “hover” for color change and  one click to navigate.</dd>
          <dt> <b>V.</b> This user testing also made me aware of some inconsistencies in my design where the buttons shift slightly or the colors change unnecessarily.</dt>
          <dd>I went back to discover and remedy any inconsistencies throughout the site.</dd>

        <p>From my usability testing I learned that the site was much too dark and didn’t have the visual appeal I wanted it to. The all blue color scheme felt a lot like several other well known brands so I decided to conduct this preference test to determine which color scheme would be best for the overall finished dreamers design. I recieved overwhelming support for option ‘C’ so Dreamers-refined was born.</p>

        <p>This is the design progression throughout all of my iterations visualized using the dashboard; for many of these I only designed the dashboard before iterating the design again; not every frame.</p>

        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>While crafting the survey for this project I included too many short answer questions which lead to a lot of data, but most of it was muddled and had no consensus. When I was crafting the survey I was determined to believe that short-answer questions would give me the best range of data to work with. This project was a hard lesson on how wrong I was and how an unhelpful survey can cause significant scope creep, iterations, and an unfriendly user design. Partially due to the survey, but also partially due to my incessant need to attempt to overachieve and do more than was asked, I ended up creating a much larger project for myself by going beyond what my client asked for and offering many features that while they are neat; they only took time away from the rest of the design that mattered more to the client and users. While because I had made this project into something so much bigger I needed to make SIGNIFICANTLY more screens than I had anticipated or had time to make so many screens were rushed which is why the design was plagued with jumping elements until I eliminated some of the extra factors and brought Dreamers back into the scope of the project. After that I was able to give more attention to the layout and colors themselves and bring Dreamers back around to really create a design I was happy with and proud of.
