        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <div class="bg_text">
          <p>This was a team project that involved all members of the design team. </p>
          <!-- My roles/tools -->
          <h5>My Role</h5>
          <p>I was one of the UX/UI designers, I was responsible for mockup and prototype creation aspects of this project, with a focus on image layer UI.</p>
          <h5>Tools</h5>
          <p>Figma, Maze, Figjam</p>
        </div>

      <!-- Challenge -->
      <section data-aos="fade-left" class="challenge">
          <h2>Approach</h2>
        <div class="bg_text">
          <p>A field page contains all of the data and actions associated with that particular field. Current map-centric UI poses significant space limitations and causes a significant amount of support tickets.</p>
          <p>Additionally, a highly requested feature over the years has been image layer comparison. Because I was already tasked with image layer redesign, I was also challenged to ideate on this concept and include image layer comparison in my designs. Even if this feature would not be included in the MVP due to technical constraints, we wanted to account for it in our designs to ensure this UI would be sufficient for the future as well.</p>
          <p>Our challenge as a team was to reimagine and redesign this experience.</p>

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <div class="bg_text">
            <p>Two different views for a field page to satisfy two primary customer types.</p>

        <div data-aos="fade-left">
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <div class="bg_text">
            <p>We started out as a team researching competitors and collecting screenshots of our favorites in Figma to use as inspiration.</p>
            <p>Then we interviewed many different customer types and plotted out the user experience from end to end.</p>
            <p>Finally, we ideated on possible solutions and started creating mockups + prototypes to validate our design decisions.</p>
          </div>

    <!-- Mockup + Prototype -->
      <section class="Mockup + Prototype">
        <div data-aos="fade-right">
          <h2>Mockup + Prototype</h2>
          <div class="bg_text">
            <p>During the ideation process I created a multitude of different mockups to work out concepts for image layer UI. As we all worked in Figma, I was able to get constant feedback from the team during this process. This was very helpful and led to a significant amount of actionable feedback. </p>
            <p>After zeroing in on one concept to fully flesh out, I created a clickable prototype for the team to use for presentation and testing.</p>

          <h2>Validating the design</h2>
          <div class="bg_text">
              <p>Once the prototype was completed, the team presented it to project stakeholders and validated the design via user testing in Maze.</p>

            <p>Caring for a Design System and maintaining it over time is just as important as creating it in the first place. An important part of this is thoroughly vetting additions to the design system to maintain integrity of the design system and manage unnecessary expansion.</p>
            <p>This means that components only used on one page or in a singular instance were not added to the design system.</p>

      <!-- Result -->
      <section data-aos="fade-right" class="Learning">
        <h2>Result</h2>
        <div class="bg_text">
          <p>The implementation of the design system was a huge success. Not only did it improve our speed and consistency in mockups, but it made the onboarding experience for new team members much easier. The team has saved countless hours of tedious work because we are able to reuse components from the library and adhere to established design guidelines.</p>
