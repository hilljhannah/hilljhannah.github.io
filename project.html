      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>There are many well-known cloud storage sites in use today but they are all designed for one set of tasks or user group and many are hard to use and lack a solid organizational users. So I was tasked to create a cloud storage site that would be intuitive to use as well as aesthetically pleasing and unique.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>My client came to me with a lot of excitement for the possibilities in the cloud storage industry market. They believed that the market is still young and that the right competitor, with the right features, could dominate the market.
        <br>
        My client also requested these features be included
        <ul>
          <li>Saving content you find on the web (links, images, videos, etc.)</li>
          <li>Organizing that content (via categories, tags, groups, and/or folders)</li>
          <li>Creating content</li>
          <li>Uploading files (from a computer or mobile device)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        They also said that they felt collaboration would an important aspect of the site to leverage growth and a requested feature by its users; and such these features were requested as well
        <ul>
          <li>Sharing a single item with someone else (and vice-versa)</li>
          <li>Sharing a folder or group of items with someone else (and vice-versa)</li>
          <li>Connecting with other users for real-time collaboration in notes or documents</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        My client also had no brand direction or identity.

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <div class=”col2”>
        <p>Through user research and competitive analysis I discovered that there was a gap in the market for a competitor with a large amount of free, secure storage with a broad target audience of anyone who has a dream with three “dreamer” sub types. Then through the creation of user story and user personas; I discovered the features users actually wanted and needed. And so the concept of Dreamers was born; with 20GB of free secure cloud storage, the ability to upload files and images, download, edit, add and sort by folder, add and sort by label, create documents, spreadsheets, notes, presentations, as well as share content and collaborate via video conference. I then put it all into action with user flows, wireframes, mockups, branding, prototypes, and tested it all with mockup usability testing and analysis.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>To Determine if there is a current userbase for cloud storage service sites</li>
        <li>Discover how current users would organize their content</li>
        <li>Identify user interest in collaboration, organization, and file saving features</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Results:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>88% of users reported using cloud storage services</li>
        <li>95.2% reported wanting to use folders to organize their content</li>
        <li>47.6% reported wanting to use labels</li>
        <li>There was also a general interest in collaboration features</li>

        <h2>Competitive Analysis<h2>
        <p>After the creation of my user personas I completed a competitive analysis on the three major players in the cloud storage and organization industry to determine the strengths and weaknesses of these three companies: Google Drive, Evernote, Dropbox.</p>
        <!--Evernote-->
        <div class="competitor">
          <img src="images/evernote.jpg" alt="Evernote dashboard"/>
          <h4>Evernote</h4>
          <p>Evernote is a convenient note-taking app with both a mobile and desktop presence. It allows for the transcription of handwritten notes to typed text and the recording of audio notes. It also offers in-text search for notes uploaded to the site. Evernote also offers the option of an unlimited uploads.
            <br>However, in order to have access to the unlimited uploads feature you must purchase one of their plans. The user home dashboard is heavily cluttered, and very confusing for a first time user to navigate. It also uses Google cloud to store the files uploaded to Evernote and overall the site has poor security.</p>
        </div>
        <!--dropbox-->
        <div class="competitor">
          <img src="images/dropbox.jpg" alt="Dropbox dashboard"/>
          <h4>Dropbox</h4>
          <p>Dropbox has a very clean and user-friendly interface. The blue used to highlight important parts of the page is very helpful and nice to have. The ability to “star” an item also allows for some organization and the file list is clear and easy to read. Dropbox also had the fastest file upload time of the three.
            <br>However, Dropbox only gives 2gb of free storage to its users and has only one 1,000gb plan available. It also only has three compatible productivity apps and has been plagued with security breaches and questionable practices for the past several years.</p>
        </div>
        <!--google drive-->
        <div class="competitor">
          <img src="images/googledrive.jpg" alt="Google drive dashboard"/>
          <h4>Google Drive</h4>
          <p>Google Drive offered the largest amount of free storage, 15gb, for its users out of the other two I researched and its in-house productivity suite with a myriad of comparable apps was a nice feature. Google Drive also offered good collaboration features with the ability to share and collaborate on content in real time with other users. It also offered enhanced security via two-factor authentication methods.
            <br>However, while Google Drive has a clean layout , it sacrificed an intuitive user-friendly interface in favor of a minimalist look. There is also no easy way to organize or sort files and there are a lot of small icons that look similar that must be hovered over/clicked on in order to figure out what they were for. Slow file upload and sync times send some users looking toward other alternatives amid security concerns over Google Drive scanning every file uploaded to its cloud servers.</p>

        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <p>After the creation of my user personas I used the data I had previously gathered in my research to create a list of high, medium, and low priority user stories. For the sake of staying within the scope of the project I focused on mainly the high, with a few medium, priority user stories for the creation of my user flows.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“As a new user, I want to sign up”</li>
          <li>“As a returning user, I want to login”</li>
          <li>“As a new or returning user, I want to create content”</li>
          <li>“As a new or returning user, I want to share content”</li>
          <li>“As a new or returning user, I want to edit content”</li>
          <li>“As a new or returning user, I want to organize content”</li>
          <li>“As a new or returning user, I want to upload content”</li>
          <li>“As a new or returning user, I want to collaborate on content”</li>
          <li>“As a new or returning user, I want to video call to collaborate with other users”</li>
          <li>“As a new or returning user, I want to download content”</li>
          <li>“As a new or returning user, I want to view and modify account settings”</li>

        <p>I created a moodboard for this project to help me visualize what I wanted Dreamers Cloud Storage to be about and what feeling and message I wanted it to convey, this was very helpful in crafting the brand ideals as well as the logo.</p>

        <p>After creating quickly hand-drafting rough page outlines with a pen and paper for the major pages I thought I was going to need for the site I created digital wireframes for all the screens needed to complete each of my high priority user stories. Here is where I realized that I didnt sketch nearly enough frames so this part became lengthly and time consuming but important for the usability and design of the project.</p>

<!--user testing-->

        <img class="icon" src="images/user-testing.icon.jpg" alt="user testing icon"/>
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>I created a working prototype with my wireframes using InVision and tested it with two different types of users. I tested it both in-person and remotely using screen record and video calling using an identical testing script to help assure testing result accuracy. I asked each tester to complete three tasks on the site: sign up for an account, add a piece of content, and organize a piece of content. Neither user had any significant issues completing the tasks and did so with little to no input or help from me.</p>
        <h5>User comments</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to navigate</li>
          <li>Clean layout</li>
          <li>Colorful & fun</li>
          <li>Unique site</li>
          <li>Intuitive to use</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Changes to be made</h5>
        <p>After concluding my user testing on the wireframes one main issue with the design became clear; the navigation buttons look like selection buttons and not like navigation buttons which caused users some trouble while navigating the site. Before moving on to the initial high-fidelity mock-up I changed the navigation button from the top version to the bottom version and implemented it throughout the site.</p>

        <h2>Initial Mockup</h2>
        <p>When I initially layered on the skins to my wire-frames I wanted to use a lot of bright colors for every page. When I first had the idea it seemed fun and colorful, in execution it was overwhelming. After going back over my design I realized that all of these colors didn't add anything to the design, in fact they took away from it significantly. The readability of the whole site was poor so before I even did any user testing I went back and revised the color scheme and design for the Dreamers site to tone it down. I also got carried away with my use of multiple background types and images. This step was a really big learning lesson about editing your work and really thinking about your design choice before executing it and evaluating later.</p>

      <h2>Design Iteration I</h2>
      <p>After my initial high-fidelity mock-up it became very clear that I needed to tone down my color palate significantly and so I went back over and got rid of all the neon-esq colors and replaced them with a darker blue and dusty purple toned color palette. The buttons also took on a more rounded look and the file images were taking up too much space on the initial wireframes so I scaled down those as well.</p>

        <p>I wanted to tweak a few elements of the design so I completed three user preference tests using Utest</p>
        <section class="test-bg">
          <h4>First Test - Page Background</h4>
          <p>The results from this preference test was somewhat inconclusive because while there was a winner it was not a clear winner and the comments from the test takers were conflicting and muddled. This was the first indication that I might need to completely change my design.</p>

        <h2>Design Dilemma</h2>
        <p>Throughout the preference tests one thing still bothered me, the background and layout. I felt as if I had a lot of wasted space on the page by confining the page content into a box on the page. I knew I wanted to keep the star/space theme but I wanted to brighten it up and not make it feel so dark and gloomy and give the content room to breathe; & the revised Dreamers was born! </p>

        <h2>Design Iteration II</h2>
        <p>By eliminating the whole image background, more space could be given to the files and it allowed me to further visually separate the folders/buttons from the files on the user dashboard. I also utilized a blue tone color scheme throughout with the image as the header throughout. I also removed the boxes around the files and moved them closer together in order to fit more files on the screen and better utilize the space on the page.</p>

        <p>For this second round of prototype testing I used an identical testing script and I tested three users. Overall I got good results from my user tests. All three users enjoyed the site as a whole and had no problems navigating around the site.</p>
        <h5>Issues & Changes</h5>
        <!--list within a list-->
        <dl>
          <dt>When rendered on a desktop the screens were fine but when viewed on a Mac-book the design was way too big.</dt>
          <dd>• I believe this may be due to the prototype being in Figma as the frame sizes are standard and should have no issues scaling properly.</dd>
          <dt>There were unintentionally two different types of screens for an overlay (one for the folder and one for labels).</dt>
          <dd>• Both screens were changed to the label format.</dd>
          <dt>On the sign up screen the highlighted “box” moves along the page and seems disorganized.</dt>
          <dd>• All screens were changed to reflect the middle formatting.</dd>
          <dt>Most buttons had to be clicked twice (once to select one to navigate) and caused a lot of confusion.</dt>
          <dd>• Changed buttons to be “hover” for color change and  one click to navigate.</dd>
          <dt>This user testing also made me aware of some inconsistencies in my design where the buttons shift slightly or the colors change unnecessarily.</dt>
          <dd>• I went back to discover and remedy any inconsistencies throughout the site.</dd>

        <h2>Preference Testing II</h2>
        <p>From my usability testing I learned that the site was much too dark and didn’t have the visual appeal I wanted it to. The all blue color scheme felt a lot like several other well known brands so I decided to conduct this preference test to determine which color scheme would be best for the overall finished dreamers design.
I recieved overwhelming support for option ‘C’ so Dreamers-refined was born.</p>

        <h2>Final Design</h2>
        <p>The preference test further supported my belief in the need to change the color scheme to mauve/purple with yellow-orange as an accent color. Changing the colors gave the site a more luxurious and dreamy cloud feel which better represents the brand and its ideals.</p>

        <h2>Design Progression - Dashboard</h2>
        <p>This is the design progression throughout all of my iterations visualized using the dashboard; for many of these I only designed the dashboard before iterating the design again; not every frame.</p>

<!--lessons learned-->

        <img class="icon" src="images/learning.icon.jpg" alt="Project takeways icon"/>
        <h2>Project Takeways</h2>
        <p>While crafting the survey for this project I included too many short answer questions which lead to a lot of data, but most of it was muddled and had no consensus. When I was crafting the survey I was determined to believe that short-answer questions would give me the best range of data to work with. This project was a hard lesson on how wrong I was and how an unhelpful survey can cause significant scope creep, iterations, and an unfriendly user design. Partially due to the survey, but also partially due to my incessant need to attempt to overachieve and do more than was asked, I ended up creating a much larger project for myself by going beyond what my client asked for and offering many features that while they are neat; they only took time away from the rest of the design that mattered more to the client and users. While because I had made this project into something so much bigger i needed to make SIGNIFICANTLY more screens than I had anticipated or had time to make so many screens were rushed which is why the design was plagued with jumping elements until I eliminated some of the extra factors and brought Dreamers back into the scope of the project. After that I was able to give more attention to the layout and colors themselves and bring Dreamers back around to really create a design I was happy with and proud of.

        <ul>
          <li>Stay within the scope of the project</li>
          <li>Dont overthink my design</li>
          <li>Create good, through survey questions to be a better asset to the process</li>
