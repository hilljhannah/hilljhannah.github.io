      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>In today's world a significant amount of our lives are spent interacting with technology to better ourselves and our lives yet when it comes to managing mental health there is a complete lack of minimalist options in the market today. Noticing this absence we wanted to change that and create a visually appealing, minimalist app to help its users track and record their moods to help identify trends and help improve its users mental health.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>There is a significant lack of ways to track and journal mental health in this modern, fast-paced world we live in. The average person could benefit from simply being aware of their emotional state and how their year and month have been going and could greatly improve their mental health this way. Yet the current barren app market doesn't reflect this; the apps that do exist in the market to record or journal mental health are either expensive with no free option or have outdated & unfriendly user interfaces.</p>
      <p>The project also had no brand identity.</p>

          <p>After extensive user research, personas, wireframing, testing, prototyping, countless iterations, and branding the concept of Mood was born; a free, easy, and colorful way to track and record your moods and emotional health throughout the year. Featuring daily reminders with a customizable time so you never miss an entry, the ability to analyze yearly mood summary to receive a detailed breakdown of your emotional health, exportable journal for personal records or sharing with a mental health professional, and a short and sweet journal prompt so you end every journal on a happy and positive note.</p>

      <h2>User Survey Research</h2>
      <p>I crafted a user survey and sent it out to my fellow designers, friends, family, and a few subreddits to give me to broadest possible pool of surveyors and responses to help me discover my target audience and learn the following:</p>
      <ul class="color">
        <li>How well known are mental health/mood apps?</li>
        <li>Are they currently being used?</li>
        <li>Is there a general interest in emotional journal apps?</li>
        <li>Are there any user concerns?</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="left">Key Findings:</h5>
      <ul class="color">
        <li><b>57%</b> said yes they were aware of mental health/ mood tracking and journal apps yet; <b>29%</b> have ever used a mental health/ mood app and only <b>11%</b> still use one.</li>
        <li><b>54%</b> said yes and <b>46%</b> said no when asked if they had concerns over mental health tracking and journal apps</li>
        <li><b>Privacy, Security, and Anonymity</b> were the top three concerns.</li>

      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>After completing the user survey and analyzing the results three main competitors became apparent; Moodnotes, MoodTrack, and a Year in Pixels. After discovering the main competitors a SWOT table and competitive analysis were done on these three apps to discover more about the potential competition our app will face.</p>
      <div class="SWOT">
      <!--Moodnotes-->
      <div class="competitor">
        <img class="comp_img" src="images/mood/moodnotes-logo.png" alt="Moodnotes logo" style="width:100px;">
        <p><b>Moodnotes</b><br>Moodnotes allows its users to record their moods using colors and emoji-like faces, then prompting users with a series of questions to journal and help the user figure out why they are feeling the way that they are.</p>
        <p>However, there is <b>no free version</b> of the app offered, only a single paid version for $4.99+ tax on the app store. Because of this many users that could benefit immensely from this app are <b>unable to even access a reduced version of it for free.</b> The fact that there is no formal way to try out the app and only a few product screenshots to give users an idea of the product they are purchasing makes this a very very niche product not something for anyone looking to better themselves.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="competitor">
          <img class="comp_img" src="images/mood/moodtrack-logo.png" alt="MoodTrack Journal and Diary logo" style="width:100px;">
          <p><b>Moodtrack Social Diary</b><br>MoodTrack has a strong social aspect with the "everyone" public feed with an anonymous chat feature and search feature so users can search and follow friends, family, or therapists by username. Users can see how others are feeling and anonymously chat with them.</p>
          <p>However, all diary entries and moods in the free app are <b>automatically publicly posted</b> on a nearby user feed along with the user's screen name unless the app is upgraded to the paid version. The app itself feels outdated with bland colors and random imagery and very unintuitive user interface.  The application icon itself also looks very similar to many other well-known apps. This coupled with the fear of <b>very sensitive private information</b> being continually publicly available causes users to look for a better solution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="competitor">
          <img class="comp_img" src="images/mood/yearinpixels-logo.png" alt="A Year in Pixels" style="width:100px;">
          <p><b>A Year in Pixels</b><br>A Year in Pixels has a simple layout and offers its users the ability to see their moods analyzed in a monthly pie chart or graph with percentages for each mood entered that month.</p>
          <p>However,the app uses <b>multiple different display fonts</b> and one cursive display font that make some parts of the app hard to read for the mobile user. The icons used throughout the site are also of varying size and weight and an <b>annoying ad bar</b> at the bottom hinders the user experience. Every few actions a full-screen add interrupts the user on in addition to the continual ad-bar. In order to be able to change the colors associated with each mood, the user has to upgrade to the “full experience” that cost $7.99.  In order to customize the month interval, the user has to upgrade as well. The extravagant pricing mixed with the outdated feel and poor UI choices causes users to look for alternatives.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="takeways">
        <h4>Key Takeways</h4>
        <p>During this section of the process a lot was learned about what current apps are doing well and what they are doing very wrong. It was discovered that while Moodnotes was the most user intuitive and well designed app the paywall barrier was a huge setback and turnoff for many users. Year in Pixels had the best concept for a free app but the poor font choices and the constant adds at the bottom and throughout the app coupled with a poor UI were a huge problem. MoodTrack was not much better with an outdated UI and everything posted is public unless it was paid for.</p>

        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <p>After the creation of user personas the research previously gathered was used to create a list of high, medium, and low priority user stories. For the sake of staying within the scope of the project the focus was on primarily the high, with a few medium, priority user stories for the creation of user flows.</p>

      <h2>Sitemap & Content Strategy</h2>
      <p>I then drafted the sitemap and content strategy doc to detail how the pages within the application are going to be laid out as well as detail what is going to be on that page. The most challenging parts of the task were deciding what content should go on what page and how that page should be nested in the site. This was challenging because We wanted to stay within the project scope and MVP but still deliver an effective solution. We solved these problems by first creating a rough sitemap outline and then doing a few pre-wireframe sketches to help visualize page layout and necessary content. Using these tools, a content strategy doc was completed and the sitemap drafted.</p>

      <h2>Wireframe Sketching</h2>
      <p>Before committing wireframes to Figma, wireframe sketches were created on paper to aid in rapid prototyping and allow quick iterations. This turned out to be specifically beneficial for this project because two rounds of sketching iterations the app already went through helped make the creation and iteration of the multiple rounds of plain wireframes go much faster and easier.</p>

      <h2>Wireframing - Initial</h2>
      <p>Upon iterative sketching and moving onto wireframing it became clear that one immediate iteration would be needed. After some additional confirmatory feedback it became clear that adding a series of on-boarding screens would ensure the most user friendly experience; and so on-boarding screens were added to explain the features of the application before signing up.</p>

      <h2>Wireframing - Revised</h2>
      <p>After the first round of wireframes we realized that there were way too many on boarding screens for users to swipe through and many of these screens could be combined to create a more streamlined signup process. On-boarding images were also added and the drawer re-designed to better accommodate icons.</p>

        <h2>Testing the Wireframes</h2>
        <p>After the completion of the digital wireframes some quick informal user testing was done to assess the app’s usability. I tested the following tasks and made the proceeding changes resulting in the revised wireframes.</p>
        <h5 class="left">Tasks Tested</h5>

        <h5 class="left">Issues/Changes</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>There was a lot of confusion on how to navigate the on-boarding besides “skip”; <b>added a "next" button</li>
          <li>There was also some confusion and negative comments on the drawer layout; <b>redesigned the drawer to be full length instead of half-screen coming from the top.</b></p>

        <h2>Hifi Mockup I</h2>
        <p>After the completion of branding documents brand colors and logos were added into the mockup and a few other changes highlighted in the wireframe usability testing. First, the landing background gradient was changed to be more unique and modern to better fit the feel of the app. The images were changed to have the same highlight color to have a cohesive look and skip & next buttons were placed at the bottom so they are easy to find. The drawer was also changed back to a long drawer but it now takes up over 60% of the screen for better readability and usability.</p>

        <h2>Hifi Mockup II</h2>
        <p>We liked the look of the previous mockup but it didn’t invoke the feelings we wanted it to; something was missing. After some rethinking and brainstorming; we had an idea and Mood got a darker color scheme with a whole new feel. By eliminating the bright landing screen and changing the majority of the screen backgrounds to dark Mood took on a more sleek and modern look all while reducing eyestrain for short or extended periods of time.</p>

        <p>A lot of things went really well with this project and I am super happy with the result; it has come a long way. The logo and the color scheme for Mood perfectly represent what I wanted Mood to feel like. One of the things that clearly worked well on this project was changing the background color to dark; it gives it a more refined and modern feel. The user survey I crafted for this project was a big improvement in utility over past user surveys. One of the main things that I wish I could have done differently is fully record all of my user testing completed. Many of the earlier tests I did without recording or taking many notes; just using the feedback. This saved me a little time initially but in the long run a recording could have been a much better asset than some scattered notes. I also wish I would have completed more preference tests because the few I did helped me immensely. Throughout the duration of this project I kept a design journal to help record and organize my thoughts and documents. That journal became an invaluable resource not only throughout the project but also the creation of the case study. I fully intend on keeping a design journal for all my future projects as well. Throughout the course of this project we had a lot of successes but also some failures but in both some important lessons were learned. </p>
