      <p>Design has always been important to me even when I was young simply spending endless hours building and designing the perfect creation with legos not a single one was ever perfect, something could always have been done to improve it and make it just a little bit better.</p>
      <p>This thought of continually wanting to improve on everything I created grew to including the want to improve not only my own creations but the things around me, I just never knew how to apply it. I was stuck a few years out of high school in a retail management position and I hated it. I hated how there were so many broken things but no one would listen to my ideas until I was in a management position but even then I had very limited creative freedom and had to watch terrible product   display designs come through the store directive with nothing to do but as they said. I saw more use of comic sans as a proprietary font than anyone should ever encounter. What retail did teach me however, was how to be resourceful and think out of the box and manage multiple large projects as a single entity simultaneously.</p>
      <p> I knew I needed to get out of retail but I had no idea what I wanted to do/what direction I was going to take until my brother told me about a website design program to become a UX/UI designer and he told me to look it up because he thought I would like it…. That was the best choice I ever made. As soon as I knew what a UX/UI designer was and how they used the steps of the design process like the building blocks of legos to create a brand, website, app, or all of the above; I was hooked. I could combine my past love of building and creating with newfound knowledge and love of website development and design, it was perfect! </p>
      <p>I love to continually improve and I aim to never settle for the status quo; in my life,  in my designs, and in my work I am never resting because nothing is ever truly “done” there is always something, even a small detail, that could be made better if you have the time. I want to make some of the most unique and interesting sites on the internet and through UX/UI Design; now I can.</p>
