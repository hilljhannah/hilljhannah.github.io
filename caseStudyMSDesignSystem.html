                        <p>One of the first problems I faced was components in the existing system were difficult to find.</p>
                        <p>As a solution, I created the structure for our Design System using Atomic Design principles by Brad Frost as a guide. It is divided up into five sections: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. Each “level” builds upon the last - starting with the atoms, and eventually leading to page templates. This structure inherently creates an extremely flexible Design System that is easy to use.</p>

This foundation made it easier for designers to create a consistent content hierarchy and user experience across our products.</p>

                        <p>Previously, five component sets would be needed with one set for each product. But by utilizing tokens and variables, it was possible to support our five products using a single component set.</p>

                        <p>Working with UX leads I developed and implemented our Design System Governance Process. This process defined how a component should be added to, updated, or removed from our Design System. To aid users with understanding the process, I created a flow diagram and added it to our system for future reference.</p>

                    <p class="subtext1">Design System and Component Library Retro</p>
                    <p>Hosting the Retro, I brought together design and development leads to discuss our Design System/Component Library. We focused on what was working, what was not, and what we could improve on.</p>
                    <p class="subtext1">Office Hours</p>
                    <p>I wanted to make sure I had blocked off time available, twice a week, where Designers could meet with me as a resource. Designers asked questions about components, how to use them, which one to use for a specific use case, or potential updates they wanted to request.</p>
                    <p class="subtext1">Component Review</p>
                    <p>On a weekly basis I held a component review, bringing together UX Leads. We discussed new component requests, how the components might be used in their product(s), any concerns, and to review component documentation. This review was invaluable because it allowed me to validate component utility and flexibility cross-functionally.</p>
                    <p>These are just a few of the many essential feedback loops I incorporated into our Design System.</p>

                    <p>To help designers when deciding which component to use and when, clear documentation was needed. Unfortunately, due to MS 3.0 being a new library, there was no existing documentation. </p>
                    <p>Creating good component documentation is essential to any Design System or Component Library. It is extremely helpful for recording design decisions, development specs, micro-interactions, anatomy, and usage standards.</p>

Over time this evolved to include a detailed change log on each component page; documenting what changed after and what the component looked like before. </p>
