      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>In today's world a significant amount of our lives are spent interacting with technology to better ourselves and our lives yet when it comes to managing mental health there is a complete lack of minimalist options in the market today. Noticing this absence we wanted to change that and create a visually appealing, minimalist app to help its users track and record their moods to help identify trends and help improve its users mental health.</p>
      <p>The project also had no brand identity.</p>

          <p>After extensive user research, personas, wireframing, testing, prototyping, countless iterations, and branding the concept of Mood was born; a free, easy, and colorful way to track and record your moods and emotional health throughout the year. Featuring daily reminders with a customizable time so you never miss an entry, the ability to analyze yearly mood summary to receive a detailed breakdown of your emotional health, exportable journal for personal records or sharing with a mental health professional, and a short and sweet journal prompt so you end every journal on a happy and positive note.</p>

      <p>After completing the user survey and analyzing the results three main competitors became apparent; Moodnotes, MoodTrack, and a Year in Pixels. After discovering the main competitors a SWOT table and competitive analysis were done on these three apps to discover more about the potential competition our app will face.</p>
      <div class="takeways">
        <h5>Key Takeways</h5>
        <p>During this section of the process a lot was learned about what current apps are doing well and what they are doing very wrong. It was discovered that while Moodnotes was the most user intuitive and well designed app the paywall barrier was a huge setback and turnoff for many users. Year in Pixels had the best concept for a free app but the poor font choices and the constant adds at the bottom and throughout the app coupled with a poor UI were a huge problem. MoodTrack was not much better with an outdated UI and everything posted is public unless it was paid for.</p>

      <p>Upon iterative sketching and moving onto wireframing it became clear that one immediate iteration would be needed. After some additional confirmatory feedback via usability testing it became clear that adding a series of on-boarding screens would ensure the most user friendly experience; and so on-boarding screens were added to explain the features of the application before signing up.</p>

        <p>After gaining feedback during wireframe usability testing a few key changes were made. First, the landing background gradient was changed to be more unique and modern to better fit the feel of the app. The images were changed to have the same highlight color to have a cohesive look and skip & next buttons were placed at the bottom so they are easy to find. The drawer was also changed back to a long drawer but it now takes up over 60% of the screen for better readability and usability.</p>

By eliminating the bright landing screen and changing the majority of the screen backgrounds to dark Mood took on a more sleek and modern look all while reducing eyestrain for short or extended periods of time.</p>

      <p>Before another round of iterations formal in-person usability tests were done on two different types of potential users utilizing a testing script to test the product usability. The feedback was majorly positive with only one minor complaint; users want a demo verson.
        Keeping this feedback in mind, a more detailed prototype was created; now with a demo feature to try the app before signing up and set daily reminder interactivity. </p>

        <p>After finishing the changes from the user testing the opportunity arose to further refine and develop an interactive prototype. This time around both the frames and the prototype were made using Figma to help aid in rapid refinement and testing. This additional time to refine and prototype immensely benefited the project and lead to changes in button coloring, new entry process, and app-wide interactivity.</p>

        <h2>Testing the Wireframes</h2>
        <p>After the completion of the digital wireframes some quick informal user testing was done to assess the app’s usability. I tested users' ability to <b>sign up for an account,
        record a new journal entry, analyze summary, view settings, and add new mood.</b> After usability testing the following iterations were made and the revised wireframes created.</p>
        <h5 class="left">Iterations</h5>
        <p>Due to confusion on how to navigate the on-boarding besides “skip”, a "next" button was added.</p>
        <img class="changes-img" src="images/mood/onboarding-redesign.png" alt="Before and after img"/>
        <p>Due to additional confusion and negative comments on the drawer layout, the drawer was also redesigned to be full length instead of half-screen coming from the top.</p>

        <h2>A/B Testing</h2>
        <p>During iterations, I was conflicted on the colors for the splash and landing page designs so I created and deployed a quick A/B preference test to get some feedback and finalize my decision.</p>
        <h5 class="left">Results</h5>
        <p>The results were very conclusive with option B receiving 75% of responses. This turned out to be a very helpful and successful preference test because the majority of responses received aligned with the Mood brand and ideals as well as overall project design.</p>

      <h4>Mind Map & Thought List</h4>
      <p>I created a mind map and thought list while brainstorming the branding for this project to help visualize and create the Mood brand.</p>
      <div class="Brand">
        <h4>Brand Ideals</h4>
        <p><strong> Modern • </strong>With a minimalist interface, recognizable fonts, and a refined color palette Mood is a modern app built for the 21st century.</p><br>
        <p><strong> Secure • </strong>All your private emotions and journals are stored within the application but your data never leaves your device so your private data stays private.</p><br>
        <p><strong> Motivational • </strong>Motivates you to journal daily to record, analyze, and manage your emotional health.</p><br>
        <p><strong> Colorful • </strong>Using preset or custom colors to represent associated emotions; visualize your moods in your yearly summary, monthly analysis, or daily journal.</p><br>
        <p><strong> Calm • </strong>The use of a dark background and non-aggressive color scheme invoke calming feelings.</p><br>
        <h4>Colors</h4>
        <img class="colors" src="images/mood/colors.png" alt="brand colors"/>
        <p>Using color palette of a soft rainbow gradient of colors for the logo and a bright turquoise as the highlight color paired with dark greys and white It gives the feeling of security, creativity, and refinement to the brand and app.</p>
        <h4>Logo Design</h4>
        <div class="fullWidthContainer"><img class="fullWidthImg" src="images/mood/logo-sketches.jpg" alt="Logo Sketches"/></div>
        <p>After creating a mind map and thought list I settled on the name "Mood" for the project and started sketching out logo designs. After sketching out ideas I digitally re-created a few of the best ideas and settled on  and quick preference test was done to determine which logo style would be further refined and developed to become the final Mood logo.</p>

    <!--lessons learned-->
    <section class="Learning">
        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>A lot of things went really well with this project and I am super happy with the result; it has come a long way. The logo and the color scheme for Mood perfectly represent what I wanted Mood to feel like. One of the things that clearly worked well on this project was changing the background color to dark; it gives it a more refined and modern feel. The user survey I crafted for this project was a big improvement in utility over past user surveys. One of the main things that I wish I could have done differently is fully record all of my user testing completed. Many of the earlier tests I did without recording or taking many notes; just using the feedback. This saved me a little time initially but in the long run a recording could have been a much better asset than some scattered notes. I also wish I would have completed more preference tests because the few I did helped me immensely. Throughout the duration of this project I kept a design journal to help record and organize my thoughts and documents. That journal became an invaluable resource not only throughout the project but also the creation of the case study. I fully intend on keeping a design journal for all my future projects as well. Throughout the course of this project we had a lot of successes but also some failures but in both some important lessons were learned. </p>
        <br>
        <h5>Key Lessons Learned</h5>
        <ul class="color">
          <li>You can never do too many preference tests</li>
          <li>Record every usability test</li>
          <li>Keep crafting good surveys</li>
          <li>Keep a design journal for every project</li>
        </ul>
