          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>In today's world a significant amount of our lives are spent interacting with technology to better ourselves and our lives yet when it comes to managing mental health there is a complete lack of minimalist options in the market today. Noticing this absence I wanted to change that and create a visually appealing, minimalist app to help its users track and record their moods to help identify trends and help improve its users mental health.</p>
          <p>The project also had no brand identity.</p>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>After extensive user research, personas, wireframing, testing, prototyping, countless iterations, and branding the concept of Mood was born; a free, easy, and colorful way to track and record your moods and emotional health throughout the year. Featuring daily reminders with a customizable time so you never miss an entry, the ability to analyze yearly mood summary to receive a detailed breakdown of your emotional health, exportable journal for personal records or sharing with a mental health professional, and a short and sweet journal prompt so you end every journal on a happy and positive note.<br><a class="inline-link" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/KafKLqGzsiWGkOScJrb3Kc/Mood-Prototype-Final?node-id=129%3A4&viewport=1177%2C170%2C0.23969630897045135&scaling=scale-down">View Prototype</a></p>

          <p>I crafted a user survey and sent it out to my fellow designers, friends, family, and a few subreddits to give me to broadest possible pool of surveyors and responses to help identify and learn more about potential target audiences and their wants and needs.

        <!--Complete Analysis-->
        <section class="comp-analysis">
          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>After completing the user survey and analyzing the results three main competitors became apparent; Moodnotes, MoodTrack, and a Year in Pixels. After discovering the main competitors a competitive analysis was completed on these three apps to discover more about the potential competition our app will face.</p>
          <!--Moodnotes->
        <div class="competitor">
          <h5>Moodnotes</h5>
          <p>Moodnotes allows its users to record their moods using colors and emoji-like faces, then prompting users with a series of questions to journal and help the user figure out why they are feeling the way that they are.</p>
          <p>However, there is <b>no free version</b> of the app offered, only a single paid version for $4.99+ tax on the app store. Because of this many users that could benefit immensely from this app are <b>unable to even access a reduced version of it for free.</b> The fact that there is no formal way to try out the app and only a few product screenshots to give users an idea of the product they are purchasing makes this a very very niche product not something for anyone looking to better themselves.</p>
        </div>
        <!-MoodTrack->
        <div class="competitor">
          <h5>Moodtrack Social Diary</h5>
          <p>MoodTrack has a strong social aspect with the "everyone" public feed with an anonymous chat feature and search feature so users can search and follow friends, family, or therapists by username. Users can see how others are feeling and anonymously chat with them.</p>
          <p>However, all diary entries and moods in the free app are <b>automatically publicly posted</b> on a nearby user feed along with the user's screen name unless the app is upgraded to the paid version. The app itself feels outdated with bland colors and random imagery and very unintuitive user interface.  The application icon itself also looks very similar to many other well-known apps. This coupled with the fear of <b>very sensitive private information</b> being continually publicly available causes users to look for a better solution.</p>
        </div>
        <!-Year in Pixels ->
        <div class="competitor">
          <h5>A Year in Pixels</h5>
          <p>A Year in Pixels has a simple layout and offers its users the ability to see their moods analyzed in a monthly pie chart or graph with percentages for each mood entered that month.</p>
          <p>However,the app uses <b>multiple different display fonts</b> and one cursive display font that make some parts of the app hard to read for the mobile user. The icons used throughout the site are also of varying size and weight and an <b>annoying ad bar</b> at the bottom hinders the user experience. Every few actions a full-screen add interrupts the user on in addition to the continual ad-bar. In order to be able to change the colors associated with each mood, the user has to upgrade to the “full experience” that cost $7.99.  In order to customize the month interval, the user has to upgrade as well. The extravagant pricing mixed with the outdated feel and poor UI choices causes users to look for alternatives.</p>
        </div>
      </div-->
          <div class="takeways">
            <h5>Key Takeways</h5>
            <p>During this section of the process a lot was learned about what current apps are doing well and what they are doing very wrong. It was discovered that while Moodnotes was the most user intuitive and well designed app the paywall barrier was a huge setback and turnoff for many users. Year in Pixels had the best concept for a free app but the poor font choices and the constant adds at the bottom and throughout the app coupled with a poor UI were a huge problem. MoodTrack was not much better with an outdated UI and everything posted is public unless it was paid for.</p>

        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <p>After the creation of user personas the research previously gathered was used to create a list of high, medium, and low priority user stories. For the sake of staying within the scope of the project the focus was on primarily the high, with a few medium, priority user stories for the creation of user flows.</p>

        <p>Upon iterative sketching and moving onto wireframing it became clear that one immediate iteration would be needed. After some additional confirmatory feedback via usability testing it became clear that adding a series of on-boarding screens would ensure the most user friendly experience; and so on-boarding screens were added to explain the features of the application before signing up.</p>

        <p>After gaining feedback during wireframe usability testing a few key changes were made. First, the landing background gradient was changed to be more unique and modern to better fit the feel of the app. The images were changed to have the same highlight color to have a cohesive look and skip & next buttons were placed at the bottom so they are easy to find. The drawer was also changed back to a long drawer but it now takes up over 60% of the screen for better readability and usability.</p>

          <h2>Final Design - Prototype III</h2>
          <p>After finishing the changes from the user testing the opportunity arose to further refine and develop an interactive prototype. This time around both the frames and the prototype were made using Figma to help aid in rapid refinement and testing. This additional time to refine and prototype immensely benefited the project and lead to changes in button coloring, new entry process, and app-wide interactivity.

            <h2>Testing the Wireframes</h2>
            <p>After the completion of the digital wireframes some quick informal user testing was done to assess the app’s usability. I tested users' ability to <b>sign up for an account,
              record a new journal entry, analyze summary, view settings, and add new mood.</b> After usability testing the following iterations were made and the mockup revised.</p>
            <h5>Iterations</h5>
            <p>Due to user confusion on how to navigate the on-boarding besides “skip” and negative comments on the drawer layout; a "next" button was added and the drawer was also redesigned to be full length instead of half-screen coming from the top.</p>

            <p>During iterations, I was conflicted on the colors for the splash and landing page designs so I created and deployed a quick A/B preference test to get some feedback and finalize my decision.</p>
            <h5>Results</h5>
            <p>The results were very conclusive with option B receiving 75% of responses. This turned out to be a very helpful and successful preference test because the majority of responses received aligned with the Mood brand and ideals as well as overall project design.</p>

            <h5>Mind Map & Thought List</h5>
            <p>I created a mind map and thought list while brainstorming the branding for this project to help visualize and create the Mood brand.</p>
            <div class="Brand">
              <h3>Brand Ideals</h3>
              <ul class="color">
                <li><i>Modern</i> • With a minimalist interface, recognizable fonts, and a refined color palette Mood is a modern app built for the 21st century.</li>
                <li><i>Secure</i> • All your private emotions and journals are stored within the application but your data never leaves your device so your private data stays private.</li>
                <li><i>Motivational</i> • Motivates you to journal daily to record, analyze, and manage your emotional health.</li>
                <li><i>Colorful</i> • Using preset or custom colors to represent associated emotions; visualize your moods in your yearly summary, monthly analysis, or daily journal.</li>
                <li><i>Calm</i> • The use of a dark background and non-aggressive color scheme invoke calming feelings.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Colors</h3>
              <img class="colors" src="images/mood/colors.png" alt="brand colors"/>
              <p>Using color palette of a soft rainbow gradient of colors for the logo and a bright turquoise as the highlight color paired with dark greys and white It gives the feeling of security, creativity, and refinement to the brand and app.</p>
              <h3>Logo Design</h3>
              <div class="imgContainer"><img class="containedImg" src="images/mood/logo-sketches.jpg" alt="Logo Sketches"/></div>
              <p>After creating a mind map and thought list I settled on the name "Mood" for the project and started sketching out logo designs. After sketching out ideas I digitally re-created a few of the best ideas and settled on  and quick preference test was done to determine which logo style would be further refined and developed to become the final Mood logo.</p>

          <!--lessons learned-->
          <section class="Learning">
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>A lot of things went really well with this project and I am super happy with the result; it has come a long way. The logo and the color scheme for Mood perfectly represent what I wanted Mood to feel like. One of the things that clearly worked well on this project was changing the background color to dark; it gives it a more refined and modern feel. The user survey I crafted for this project was a big improvement in utility over past user surveys. One of the main things that I wish I could have done differently is fully record all of my user testing completed. Many of the earlier tests I did without recording or taking many notes; just using the feedback. This saved me a little time initially but in the long run a recording could have been a much better asset than some scattered notes. I also wish I would have completed more preference tests because the few I did helped me immensely. Throughout the duration of this project I kept a design journal to help record and organize my thoughts and documents. That journal became an invaluable resource not only throughout the project but also the creation of the case study. I fully intend on keeping a design journal for all my future projects as well. Throughout the course of this project we had a lot of successes but also some failures but in both some important lessons were learned.</p>
            <h3>Key Lessons Learned</h3>
            <ul class="color">
              <li>You can never do too many preference tests</li>
              <li>Record every usability test</li>
              <li>Keep crafting good surveys</li>
              <li>Keep a design journal for every project</li>
            </ul>
